## Description

Fantasy Football has been bringing together fans for decades, while simultaneously builiding the popularity of the NFL and its players.

There is no better feeling than meeting up with your friends on draft night, with a laptop in hand, to pick the right players for your fantasy team.

Sometimes, drafts are unpredictable and you are stuck making a difficult decision. Luckily, the Fantasy Football Finder is here to help!

With FFF, you can search for any active offensive player in the NFL and view their projected stats. These stats are generated using the FantasyNerds API, which calculate projections from experts in the sports industry.
